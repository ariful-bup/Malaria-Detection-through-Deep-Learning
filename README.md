Malaria remains a significant global health concern, impacting millions of people each year as it is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, posing a life threatening risk. 
Traditional diagnostic methods, based on the manual examination of blood smears to identify infected red blood cells(RBC), are time-consuming and prone to human errors, potentially leading to inaccurate diagnoses. 
This study utilizes the potential of advanced deep learning techniques, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to revolutionize malaria detection. 
The need for accurate and efficient malaria diagnosis is crucial, particularly in regions with limited medical resources. 
In this study, we evaluated models ranging from simple CNNs to more complex deep learning (DL) and traditional machine learning (ML) approaches using a dataset of 27,560 single-cell microscopic blood images, divided into 22,048 training and 5,512 test images. 
Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency. 
Remarkably, a relatively simple CNN model outperformed more advanced alternatives, achieving 95.71% across all evaluated metrics while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. 
These findings highlight the potential of lightweight deep learning models for developing scalable and cost-effective diagnostic tools. 
Building on this, we are now developing a system optimized for real-world image quality, with the goal of delivering reliable malaria detection in remote and resource-limited settings.
